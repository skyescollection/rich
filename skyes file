As efforts continue to be made to develop a potential Covid-19 vaccine to curb the spread of the epidemic, scientists have reportedly found an important weakness in the Corona virus.

Researchers at Russia's State Vector Virology and Biotechnology Research Center in Novosibirsk, Siberia, have discovered that ordinary water can help limit the growth of the corona virus, according to Sputnik News.

The researchers found that about 90% of the virus particles die within 24 hours in room temperature water, and 99.9% of them die within 72 hours. In addition, scientists have confirmed that boiling water kills the corona virus immediately and completely.

The researchers also found that although the virus did not multiply in chlorine-free water and seawater, it could survive for some time. It should be noted that the survival time of the virus depends directly on the temperature of the water. According to the report, chlorinated water is also very effective in reducing the virus.

Russia has also had remarkable results in the field of Covid-19 vaccine.

According to reports, Russian Health Minister Mikhail Morashko said that the Gamalia Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, a state research center in Moscow, has completed clinical trials of the Covid-19 vaccine and is preparing documents for its registration.

He also said they were preparing a mass vaccination campaign against the new coronavirus for October, according to local Reuters news agencies. According to the report, Morashko added: "The authorities plan to vaccinate doctors and teachers against the virus first."

A source told Reuters this week that Russia's first potential vaccine, Covid-1919, will receive local regulatory approval in August and will then be used by health workers.
